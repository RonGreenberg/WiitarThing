# WiitarThing

I made the necessary changes to finally make it work with my old Nyko Frontman Wiitar.

## Setup

### Install WiitarThing

1. Download and install [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases).
2. Download WiitarThing from [the "Releases" tab](https://github.com/RonGreenberg/WiitarThing/releases), and extract it into a new folder.
